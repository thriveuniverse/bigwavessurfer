    <h1>About Our Surf-Loving Family</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Big Wave Surfing Hub, a family-run passion project bringing you the thrill of big wave surfing and <a href="/shop.html">hand selected gear</a> for young surfers!</p>

   

    <section class="content">
      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>We’re not pro surfers, but we’re a family with salt water in our veins. Dad used to shred waves back in the day, and though life—kids, jobs, you know—put surfing on hold, his love for big waves never faded. He’s the drive behind our visits to spots like Nazaré and the generally freezing Atlantic ocian. He bought this url many years ago always planning a site which we have now finally started.</p>
      <p>Our eldest kid is all about skateboarding but thinks surfing is pure art—those massive waves are like poetry in motion. Our youngest, a rock climber heading into Sports Science at uni, is itching to paddle out and catch their first big wave, living near the Mediteranean he has a SUP not a surfboard.  And me? I’m the non-surfer who built this site to share our family’s passion and connect with young surfers chasing the same vibe.</p>
      <p>Big Wave Surfing Hub is our way of celebrating the thrill, beauty, and community of surfing. From the world’s gnarliest surf spots to <a href="/shop.html">gear that’ll get you ready</a> for your next adventure, we’re here to inspire you to ride the giants, or simply fall in love with them!</p>
