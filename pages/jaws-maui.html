  <h2>The Apex Predator</h2>
  <p>Where Maui's Mountains Meet Ocean Monsters. Jaws (Peʻahi) is a barreling, high-speed monster that’s redefined what’s possible in surfing. A place where riders don’t just surf – they fly.</p>
</section>

    <p>Welcome to Jaws, officially known as Peʻahi, on the north shore of Maui, Hawaii. This isn't just a big wave; it's a liquid behemoth that redefines what's possible in surfing. Named "Jaws" because of the terrifying power and speed with which it can devour anything in its path, this wave is a marvel of nature – a steep, fast, barreling monster that offers the ultimate canvas for daring aerials and record-setting rides. Prepare to be blown away.</p>

    <h3>Jaws at a Glance: Quick Facts for the Adrenaline Junkies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Location:</strong> North Shore of Maui, Hawaii, USA (off the coast of Peʻahi)</li>
      <li><strong>The Secret Sauce:</strong> A unique reef formation combined with deep ocean swells and strong trade winds, producing a fast-moving, hollow, offshore-breaking wave.</li>
      <li><strong>Wave Type:</strong> Mostly a right-hand point break, with wide barrels and potential for huge aerials. A difficult left sometimes forms.</li>
      <li><strong>Best Season:</strong> Winter (November to March), fueled by massive North Pacific swells.</li>
      <li><strong>Claim to Fame:</strong> Birthplace of tow-in surfing, now a premier paddle-in big wave break. Home of the Red Bull Jaws contest.</li>
      <li><strong>Danger Level:</strong> Extreme – huge waves, sharp reef, violent hold-downs, and strong offshore winds challenge even the best.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Origin Story: Jaws' Explosive Rise to Fame</h3>
    <p>For years, Jaws was a local secret, virtually unrideable by traditional paddle-in methods due to its speed and size. That all changed in the early 1990s when legends like <strong>Laird Hamilton</strong>, <strong>Darrick Doerner</strong>, and <strong>Buzzy Kerbox</strong> pioneered <em>tow-in surfing</em> right here. Using jet skis to whip into monstrous waves at speed, they unlocked Jaws’ potential and reshaped big-wave surfing forever.</p>

    <p>As gear and technique progressed, surfers began to tackle Jaws with paddle power, marking a new era of elite surfing. Today, icons like <strong>Ian Walsh</strong>, <strong>Billy Kemper</strong>, and <strong>Kai Lenny</strong> dominate this arena, drawing fans and photographers alike to Peʻahi’s cliffs to witness the aquatic spectacle. Jaws became not just a break, but a proving ground for the world's most fearless athletes.</p>

    <h3>Why Jaws Wows & Inspires</h3>
    <p>Jaws is pure, unfiltered awe. Imagine a vertical mountain of water barreling toward shore at 30 mph — then add a surfer dropping into its face, vanishing into a cavernous tube, and sometimes flying into the air. It's a test of strength, agility, and willpower like no other.</p>

    <p>For surfers, it’s the ultimate challenge — a wave so powerful and perfect it becomes a blank canvas for creativity at scale. Jaws represents the best of surfing: nature’s fury met with human determination. It inspires because it demands more than just skill — it demands fearlessness. It’s a place where surfing transcends sport and becomes legend.</p>
