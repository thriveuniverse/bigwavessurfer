      <h2>Why Our Oceans Need Us</h2>
      <p>As a beach-loving family, we’ve seen how plastic, erosion, and pollution threaten the waves we live for. Here’s what’s at stake and how you can help.</p>

      <h3>Ocean Plastic</h3>
      <p>Every year, 8 million metric tons of plastic—think a garbage truck every minute—hit our oceans, clogging surf spots and killing marine life. <strong>“Plastic pollution is choking our oceans, killing marine life, and washing up on our favorite surf breaks.” – Ocean Conservancy</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Action</strong>: Join beach cleanups or choose <a href="https://amzn.to/3In0Vt9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plastic free surf gear</a> like recycled wetsuits.</p>

      <h3>Deforestation and Erosion</h3>
      <p>Globally, 10 million hectares of trees are cut yearly, loosening soil that washes into rivers, shallows them, and floods coasts. This messes with natures processing of water. <strong>“Cutting trees to widen rivers washes soil into our oceans, messing with waves and beaches we love.” – WWF</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Action</strong>: Support reforestation or pick <a href="/shop.html">sustainable surfboards</a> made from eco-materials.</p>

      <h3>Chemical Pollution</h3>
      <p>Farm runoff, carrying 80% of marine pollution, poisons coastal waters with pesticides, affecting surfers’ health at spots like Jaws. <strong>“Chemicals from farms are poisoning our surf spots, making every session a health risk.” – Surfrider Foundation</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Action</strong>: Advocate for cleaner farming or use <a href="https://amzn.to/3Gwv60D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">non-toxic surf wax</a>.</p>

      <h2>Paddle for the Planet</h2>
      <p>We’re not perfect, but our family is stoked to protect the oceans we love. Explore epic surf spots, grab <a href="/shop.html">eco-friendly gear</a>, and paddle out to keep the waves clean for the next generation of surfers!</p>
